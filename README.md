# Overview #
- Eslint & Prettier config files for a React app (Frontend + Backend).
- They can be used as base config files for your project.

# Usage #
1. Copy the files to their relevant root directory (i.e. backend or frontend).
2. Delete the "backend" or "frontend" prefix at the start of the filename.
- **E.g.**: Copy `backend.eslintrc.json` to the root directory of your backend, then change the filename (`backend.eslintrc.json` --> `.eslintrc.json`).
